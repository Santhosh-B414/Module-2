# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=int(input())
z=bin(a)
print(z)
```




## Output
<img width="1253" height="276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc59b176-13ab-46a5-9ac9-cdcd4805c2f9" />


## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
